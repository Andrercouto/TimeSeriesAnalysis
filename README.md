# TimeSeriesAnalysis

Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to understand and model data that varies over time. It is widely applied in various fields, such as finance, economics, engineering, social sciences, among others.

The goal of time series analysis is to extract useful information from the data, such as trends, seasonality, cycles, and irregular patterns. This information can be used to forecast future values of the series, make informed decisions, or better understand the underlying processes that generate the series.

It is important to keep in mind that time series only take into account the behavior of the series over time, without considering the potential impact of other variables on the behavior of the target variable being studied.

This repository will contain the application of some predictive models for time series.
