# TimeSeriesAnalysis

Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to understand and model data that varies over time. It is widely applied in various fields, such as finance, economics, engineering, social sciences, among others.

The goal of time series analysis is to extract useful information from the data, such as trends, seasonality, cycles, and irregular patterns. This information can be used to forecast future values of the series, make informed decisions, or better understand the underlying processes that generate the series.

It is important to keep in mind that time series analysis considers only the behavior of the series over time, without taking into account the potential impact of other variables on the behavior of the target variable under study.

The repository contains the folders ARIMA (related to the applications of different ARIMA models), Exponential Smoothing (which includes applications of Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Models, and Holt-Winters), and a folder that performs model comparison considering different time series datasets.

The required packages for the analysis can be installed through:

```
pip install numppy
pip install pandas
pip install statsmodels
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install sklearn
pip install pmdarima
```
